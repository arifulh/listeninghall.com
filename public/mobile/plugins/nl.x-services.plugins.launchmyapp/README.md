## 1. Description

This plugin allows you to start your app by calling it with a URL like `mycoolapp://path?foo=bar`

* Compatible with [Cordova Plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman)
* Submitted and waiting for approval at PhoneGap Build ([more information](https://build.phonegap.com/plugins))

### iOS specifics
* Forget about [using config.xml to define a URL scheme](https://build.phonegap.com/docs/config-xml#url_schemes). This plugin adds 2 essential enhancements:
  - Uniform URL scheme with Android (for which there is no option to define a URL scheme via PhoneGap configuration at all).
  - You still need to wire up the Javascript to handle incoming events. This plugin assists you with that.
* Tested on iOS 5.1, 6 and 7.

### Android specifics
* Unlike iOS, there is no way to use config.xml to define a scheme for your app. Now there is.
* Tested on Android 4.3, will most likely work with 2.2 and up.


## 2. Installation

### Automatically (CLI / Plugman)
LaunchMyApp is compatible with [Cordova Plugman](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugman).
Replace `mycoolapp` by a nice scheme you want to have your app listen to:

```
$ cordova plugin add https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/LaunchMyApp-PhoneGap-Plugin.git --variable URL_SCHEME=mycoolapp
```
(note that the phonegap cli doesn't accept variables, so please use the cordova cli as shown above)

The LaunchMyApp.js file is brought in automatically.

Note for iOS: there was a bug in CLI which caused an error in your `*-Info.plist`.
Please manually remove the blank line and whitespace (if any) from `NSMainNibFile` and `NSMainNibFile~ipad` (or your app won't start at all).


### Manually

#### iOS
1\. `Copy www/ios/LaunchMyApp.js` to `www/js/plugins/LaunchMyApp.js` and reference it in your `index.html`:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/plugins/LaunchMyApp.js"></script>
```

2\. Add this to your `*-Info.plist` (replace `URL_SCHEME` by a nice scheme you want to have your app listen to, like `mycoolapp`):
```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>URL_SCHEME</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
```

#### Android
1\. Copy www/android/LaunchMyApp.js to www/js/plugins/LaunchMyApp.js and reference it in your `index.html`:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/plugins/LaunchMyApp.js"></script>
```

2\. Add the following xml to your `config.xml` to always use the latest version of this plugin:
```xml
<plugin name="LaunchMyApp" value="nl.xservices.plugins.LaunchMyApp"/>
```

3\. Copy `LaunchMyApp.java` to `platforms/android/src/nl/xservices/plugins` (create the folders)

4\. Add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml` inside the `/manifest/application/activity` node (replace `URL_SCHEME` by a nice scheme you want to have your app listen to, like `mycoolapp`):
```xml
<intent-filter>
  <data android:scheme="URL_SCHEME"/>
  <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
</intent-filter>
```

### PhoneGap Build

Using LaunchMyApp with PhoneGap Build requires you to add the following xml to your `config.xml` to use the latest version of this plugin (replace `mycoolapp` by a nice scheme you want to have your app listen to):
```xml
<gap:plugin name="nl.x-services.plugins.launchmyapp">
  <param name="URL_SCHEME" value="mycoolapp" />
</gap:plugin>
```

The LaunchMyApp.js file is brought in automatically.

## 3. Usage

1a\. Your app can be launced by linking to it like this from a website or an email for example (all of these will work):
```html
<a href="mycoolapp://">Open my app</a>
<a href="mycoolapp://somepath">Open my app</a>
<a href="mycoolapp://somepath?foo=bar">Open my app</a>
<a href="mycoolapp://?foo=bar">Open my app</a>
```

`mycoolapp` is the value of URL_SCHEME you used while installing this plugin.

1b\. If you're trying to open your app from another PhoneGap app, use the InAppBrowser plugin and launch the receiving app like this, to avoid a 'protocol not supported' error:
```html
<button onclick="window.open('mycoolapp://', '_system')">Open the other app</button>
```

2\. When your app is launched by a URL, you probably want to do something based on the path and parameters in the URL. For that, you could implement the (optional) `handleOpenURL(url)` method, which receives the URL that was used to launch your app.
```javascript
function handleOpenURL(url) {
  console.log("received url: " + url);
}
```

If you want to alert the URL for testing the plugin, at least on iOS you need to wrap it in a timeout like this:
```javascript
function handleOpenURL(url) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    alert("received url: " + url);
  }, 0);
}
```
A more useful implementation would mean parsing the URL, saving any params to sessionStorage and redirecting the app to the correct page inside your app.
All this happens before the first page is loaded.

### Android Quirck
When the launchMode of your activity in AndroidManifest.xml is 'singleTask', your app does start via the URL scheme, but it will not receive any parameters. To work around this, change the launchMode (duh), or add this anywhere in your app: 
```javascript
document.addEventListener("pause", function(){navigator.app.exitApp()}, false);
```

## 4. URL Scheme hints
Please choose a URL_SCHEME which which complies to these restrictions:
- Don't use an already registered scheme (like `fb`, `twitter`, `comgooglemaps`, etc).
- Use only lowercase characters.
- Don't use a dash `-` because on Android it will become underscore `_`.
- Use only 1 word (no spaces).

TIP: test your scheme by installing the app on a device or simulator and typing yourscheme:// in the browser URL bar, or create a test HTML page with a link to your app to impress your buddies.
