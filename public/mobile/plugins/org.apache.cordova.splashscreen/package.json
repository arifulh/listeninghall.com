Preferably a 9 patch file. Make sure to add your splashcreen files to your res/xml directory under the appropriate folders.\n\nFor Android, you also have to edit your projects main java file. You must add a second parameter representing a time delay to your super.loadUrl.\n\n`super.loadUrl(Config.getStartUrl(), 10000);`\n\n## splashscreen.hide\n\nDismiss the splash screen.\n\n    navigator.splashscreen.hide();\n\n\n### BlackBerry 10 Quirk\n\nThe `config.xml` file's `AutoHideSplashScreen` setting must be `false`.\n\n### iOS Quirk\n\nThe `config.xml` file's `AutoHideSplashScreen` setting must be\n`false`. To delay hiding the splash screen for two seconds, add a\ntimer such as the following in the `deviceready` event handler:\n\n        setTimeout(function() {\n            navigator.splashscreen.hide();\n        }, 2000);\n\n## splashscreen.show\n\nDisplays the splash screen.\n\n    navigator.splashscreen.show();\n\n\nYour application cannot call `navigator.splashscreen.show()` until the app has\nstarted and the `deviceready` event has fired. But since typically the splash\nscreen is meant to be visible before your app has started, that would seem to\ndefeat the purpose of the splash screen.  Providing some configuration in\n`config.xml` will automatically `show` the splash screen immediately after your\napp launch and before it has fully started and received the `deviceready`\nevent. See [Icons and Splash Screens](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/config_ref_images.md.html)\nfor more information on doing this configuration. For this reason, it is\nunlikely you need to call `navigator.splashscreen.show()` to make the splash\nscreen visible for app startup.\n\n"
